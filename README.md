~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ALIEOMON CARDS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is Player on Player card game is based of my childhood fantacies, when me and my friends came up with a unique game that we wanted to create once we get good knowledge on Game designing
Our imaginary game was much more complex than this but I used the basic concepts of that game to fill the stats of the cards that are used in this game.

ALIEOMON CARDS has a deck of 21 cards that are either Attack, defence or spell type and each player has a lifeline of 10.Each player is given 7 cards at random
A set of random cards will be distributed to each player from the deck at the start of the game, players can view all the cards in the deck pre-game.
Each player can use one card per turn and the winner is decided if the opponent player lifeline goes to 0 or the player who has lesser lifeline points at the end of the game.
To start the game a player is chosen randomly and the player turns are decided based on that.
Player options are displayed when you start the game. Hope you enjoy this game!
